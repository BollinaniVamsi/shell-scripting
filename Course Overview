Shell script is a great way to automate repetitive task in our Linux/Unix Environment.

What is Shell Script?
Shell script is a sequence of system commands pasted in a text file. 

Example: send some XYZ Report to compliance team @ Every Friday
Report: it should contain versions info of Docker, Nginx and OS Uname

Command to find the version of Docker : Docker -v
command to find the version of Nginx: nginx -v
command to get OS uname: uname

keeping thses three commands in script
#! /bin/bash
docker -v
nginx -v
uname
mail  
to run this script on every friday, schedule this script in crontab and mail them. 

to send the only version info use the filters like "cut" command 
docker -v
docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
docker -v | cut -d " " -f 3 | tr "," " " (i used transfer to remove ",")
nginx -v 
nginx version: nginx/1.14.0 (ubuntu)
nginx -v 2>&1 | cut -d " " -f 3 | cut -d "/" -f 2

Now let us keep these steps in script to do the script complete automate
#!/bin/bash 
dockerversion=`dcoker -v | cut -d " " -f 3 | tr "," " "`
nginxversion=`nginx -v 2>&1 | cut -d " " -f 3 | cut -d "/" -f 2`
osuname=$(uname)

cat <<EOF | /usr/bin/mail -s "$(date): Compliance Report $(hostname)" "complianceteam@gmail.com"
docker Version: $dockerversion 
Nginx Version: $nginxversion
os Uname: $osuname
